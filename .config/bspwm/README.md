# BSPWM-Config

DISCLAIMER: the Readme is incomplete and so are the Scripts. Even tho it runs smooth for me expect Bugs
or missing Programms i forgot to mention.

## Structure
	Programs
	Dropdown
	Changes
	To Do

## Dependencies
	BSPWM
	alsa-utils
	sxhkdrc
	compton
	alacritty
	polybar


## Changes
### Terminal
	Terminal is set to Termite if you wish to change it you have to replace
	Termite in the sxhkdrc with the Terminal you want to use.

### Alsa Utils
	to replace Alsa Utils you have to replace the volume lines in sxhkdrc and the
	Volume dropdown in the panel.
	I don't recomend doing that unless you know what you're doing.
