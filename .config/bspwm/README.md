# BSPWM-Config

DISCLAIMER: the Readme is incomplete and so are the Scripts. Even tho it runs smooth for me expect Bugs
or missing Programms i forgot to mention.

## Structure
* Programs
* Dropdown
* Changes
* To Do

## Dependencies
* BSPWM
* alsa-utils
* sxhkdrc
* picom ([dccsillag fork](https://github.com/dccsillag/picom/tree/implement-window-animations))
* alacritty
* polybar


## Changes
### Terminal
Terminal is set to Alacritty if you wish to change it you have to replace<br>
Termite in the sxhkdrc with the Terminal you want to use.

### Alsa Utils
to replace Alsa Utils you have to replace the volume lines in sxhkdrc and the<br>
Volume dropdown in the panel.<br>
I don't recomend doing that unless you know what you're doing.
